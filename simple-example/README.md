# Example for using multi-threading, multi-processing
1. Run multi-threading-example.py
    - time python multi-threading-example.py
    - the result will be something like this:
        real	0m4.628s  Real is wall clock time
        user	0m3.921s  User is the amount of CPU time spent in user-mode code (outside the kernel) within the process.
        sys	    0m0.472s  Sys is the amount of CPU time spent in the kernel within the process.
1. Run multi-processing-example.py
    - time python multi-processing-example.py
    - the result will be something like this:
        real	0m3.375s
        user	0m4.313s
        sys	    0m1.045s
